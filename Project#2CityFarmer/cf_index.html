            <p>Urban farming is a growing trend, especially those focused on growing food.

                <ul>
                    <li>Make city farmer friends in your area. Every climate and growing season is different. Learning what specific herbs or vegetables work well in your area is essential to success.</li>
                    <li>Start small. Pick a couple of things that are easy and reliable as starters.</li>
                    <li>Use good soil. Healthy plants cannot grow without it. You may need to add compost, nitrogen, or phosphorus. Again, the veterans in your area can help you develop good soil.</li>
                    <li>Plants need sunlight. Generally vegetables can use as much sunlight as possible, but some leafy greens will do well in shaded areas too.</li>
                    <li>Plants need water. It's hard to overwater vegetables, but each plant tolerates variations in moisture differently. Generally, a little water often is your best bet.</li>
                    <li>Keep the weeds out. Weeds waste valuable space, moisture and nutrients. Weeding your garden also gives you the chance to study your crop and make adjustments.</li>
                </ul>
