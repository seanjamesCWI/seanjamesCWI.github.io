        <h1>General</h1>
        <p>I've always enjoyed learning about computers and the programs that make them run. I always want to learn more and more even though I am getting a late start on my education.</p>
        <h1>Interests</h1>
        <p>I have always been an avid gamer ever since I was young and my cousin introduced me to the world of MMORPGs. I still continue to play them in my spare time along with other genres of video games. I love learning new languages and I am currently working on Korean and Japanese. </p>
        <h1>Future Goals</h1>
        <p>Some future goals I have in mind are getting a fullfilling career in the software development field. I want to move to another part of the world where I can continue to code and see what the world has to offer. I will be graduating from CWI's Software Development program in spring of 2022 and afterwards I plan on working to get my bachelor's degree.</p>
